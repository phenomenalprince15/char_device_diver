# MISC

- A device driver provides several entry points into kernel called drivers methods.
- We can have open(), read(), write(), llseek(), release() and more.

## Basics
- A device driver is an interface betweeen the OS and peripheral hardware devices.
- It can written inline that is compiled within the kernel image file or written outside the kernel as a kernel module (LKM framework).
- For a user space to access kernel space for device driver within the kernel, some I/O mechanism is required.
- Linux design is to open a special type of file - a device file or device node. (in /dev dir) It acts as an entry point into device driver.
- For distinction between device files for kernel, it uses two attributes within inode data structure:
1. Type of file - either char or block
2. major and minor number

![device namespace](../Images/device_namespace.jpg)

### Block vs Char devices
- Block devices can be mounted and become part of user-accessible filesysmtem. Thus, storage devices used block devices.
- Char devices can't be mounted. Inlcuding I2C/SPi, sensor chips(temp, pressure, humidity), touchscreens, RTC (real time clock), media (video, camera, audio), keyboards, mouse, so on.

### Major and Minor number
- It's pair of 32-bit quantity ihtin inode, a bitmask (dev_t i_rdev member).
- MSB 12 bits are major number(0-4095) and LSB 20 bits are minor number(0-1048575).
- They represent the class of the device (is it a keyboard, terminal, a disk - pseduo hardare devices).
- The driver's interprets the device's minor number to represent either a physical or logical instance of the device.

### Linux Device Model
- It creates a tree unifying system components, all periphereal devices, their drivers.

```
wiki@pi:~$ mount | grep -w sysfs
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
wiki@pi:~$ ls -F /sys/
block/  bus/  class/  dev/  devices/  firmware/  fs/  kernel/  module/  power/
wiki@pi:~$ 
```

- Think of these dirs as viewports into LDM - different ways of viewing the devices on system.
- LDM simply is - Buses, devices on them, device drivers (also known as client drivers).

- Every single device must reside on a BUS.
- USB devices will be on usb bus, PCI devices on PIC bus, I2C devices on I2C bus and more.

```
wiki@pi:~$ ls -F /sys/bus
ac97/       cec/          container/  edac/          genpd/  i2c/       mipi-dsi/  nvmem/         pci_express/  sdio/         soc/  vchiq-bus/
amba/       clockevents/  cpu/        event_source/  gpio/   mdio_bus/  mmc/       nvmem-layout/  platform/     serial/       spi/  workqueue/
auxiliary/  clocksource/  dax/        gadget/        hid/    media/     mmc_rpmb/  pci/           scsi/         serial-base/  usb/
```

- Job of a bus: They organize and recognize the devices on them. If a new devices resurfaces, USB bus driver will recognize and bind to it's device driver.
- Once bounded: many terms are used - bound, enumerated, discovered.
- kernel driver framework invokes the registered probe() method (function) of driver and setups teh device allocating its resources, IRQs, memory setup and more.

Key aspect:
1. Register itself to a kernel framework.
2. Register itself on a BUS.

#### Kernel framework it registers itself to depends on the type of device we work with
- A drive for an RTC chip that resides on I2C bus will register itself to kerne's RTC framework via rtc_register_device() API and to I2C bus via i2c_register_driver() API.
- A driver of NIC on PCI bus will register itself to kernel's network via register_netdev() API and PCI bus via pci_register_drive() API.
- So, registering with a kernel framework is easier as it provides helper routines (and data structures) to take care of I/O details.
- Like we didn't need to know the details of how to communicate with the chip over I2C bus, bit data on Serial Clock/ Serial Data lines as I2C protocol demands.
- Kernel I2C framework provides us with convenience routines as i2c_smbus_*() APIs.
- More details: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/index.html


#### Writing the misc driver code
- We must first register our driver with the appropriate linux kernel framework (here misc framework)
- misc_register() API and include linux/miscdevice.h
```
int misc_register(struct miscdevice *misc) // to register a misc device
void misc_deregister(struct miscdevice *misc) // to de-registe a misc device

struct miscdevice *misc
- a device structure, If the minor number is set to MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR a minor number is assigned and placed in the minor field of the structure.
- The structure passed is linked into the kernel and may not be destroyed until it has been unregistered. By default, an open() syscall to the device sets file->private_data to point to the structure. Drivers donâ€™t need open in fops for this.

- A zero is returned on success and a negative errno code for failure.
```

#### Connection between process, driver and kernel
- The file_operations structure or fops.
- Majority of members of fops are function pointers (virtual methods).
- They represent all possible file system calls we could issue on a device file.
- Common as open(), read(), write(), poll(), mmap(), release() and more.
- Our job is to populate these function pointers linking them to actual code within the driver.
- More : https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html#struct-file-operations

```
struct file_operations {
        struct module *owner;
        loff_t (*llseek) (struct file *, loff_t, int);
        ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
        ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
        ssize_t (*read_iter) (struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *);
        ssize_t (*write_iter) (struct kiocb *, struct iov_iter *);
        int (*iopoll)(struct kiocb *kiocb, bool spin);
        int (*iterate_shared) (struct file *, struct dir_context *);
        __poll_t (*poll) (struct file *, struct poll_table_struct *);
       ...
       ...
       ...
        ssize_t (*copy_file_range)(struct file *, loff_t, struct file *, loff_t, size_t, unsigned int);
        loff_t (*remap_file_range)(struct file *file_in, loff_t pos_in,
                                   struct file *file_out, loff_t pos_out,
                                   loff_t len, unsigned int remap_flags);
        int (*fadvise)(struct file *, loff_t, loff_t, int);
};
```

- Once fops funcitons are setup, once driver is registered with kerrnel when any user space thread or process opens a device file registered to this driver,
the kenel Virtual FileSystem Switch (VFS) takes over.

```

    bool dma_skip_sync:1;
#endif;
#ifdef CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA;
    bool dma_iommu:1;
#endif;
};
